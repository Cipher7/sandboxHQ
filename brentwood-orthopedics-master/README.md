# Project 1 - Doctor's Office Website

#### Team
Team consists of David, Gil, Kelly, Jerrica, and Ronnie. 
We are working in a collaborative effort to 
perform a remote group website. The website will be wireframed
on draw.io then released to team for assignment selection.

Team mates will pick the section(s) they wish to work on 
and will be adding their content, images, and custom design. 

Color schemes will be selected by the group once the project
is fully built. 

Technologies used for this build include; 
- HTML/CSS, JS
- Trello and Zoom
- Git/Github
- Google Drive for shared storage
